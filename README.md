autofocus
=========

Small JavaScript snippet for automatically setting focus on any given element in page.

### Why would I want this?

So when a keyboard-loving visitor comes to your page, he doesn't have to tab 15 times to get to the most relevant element on the page (or God forbid, use his mouse).

### How do I use it?

Put id=focuselement on the element you want focus on, and include focus.js in the page.

### What if I'm using some frameworks that autogenerates the page for me, and I'd hate to go around adding that tag to all the different elements?

You could add id=focuselement on a content-div, and the script would search within that div to find an element that it likes. Hopefully, you'll like it too.
